The Price of Conformity
	In the historical novel, Wooden Fish Songs, author Ruthanne Lum McCunn follows the life  of a Chinese botanist, Gim Gong, through the perspectives of three women, each with their own story and memories of Gim Gong. One of the three is Gim Gong’s mother, Sum Jiu, who was brought up in the Chinese village of Toishan, a place deeply entrenched in religious beliefs and traditions. As a female, Sum Jiu was treated unusually well by her grandfather, which was disapproved of by her mother because it went against what her cultural definition of what a woman’s status should be. When Sum Jiu accidentally violated a strict religious belief, her mother used her religious beliefs to guilt Sum Jiu into becoming the obedient and silent woman her culture expected, despite crippling Sum Jiu’s conscience in the process. Likewise, Fanny Burlingame, another one of the three women, was a repressed and deeply religious daughter in a Christian household who wanted to become more than just a housewife during a time in American history when women are expected to become nothing else. However she was held back from her dreams by her parents, who also accused her of lacking faith in the Lord because she couldn’t excel in housework, forcing Fanny to carry a heavy guilt that led her towards self destructive behavior. The stories of both women reflect the same outline of oppression, as youths they didn’t  quite fit into her culturally conservative society, and when religious beliefs are used to make them conform, the beliefs intended to help them fit in become harmful forces in their lives.
	Sum Jiu didn’t fit into the role of females in 1800s China because she was favored and treated specially by her grandfather in a patriarchal society where males are supposed to be favored over females. From Sum Jiu’s description of her childhood, it becomes clear why it was odd for her grandfather to favor Sum Jiu. Even during dinners, Sum Jiu was shown to have a low cultural status, as she describes, “I ate only after my father and brother were finished. If on the few occasions we sat together as a family I was foolish enough to reach for a choice morsel, my mother swiftly rapped my wrist...forcing me to drop it.” (9) The fact that Sum Jiu’s own mother doesn’t allow Sum Jiu to eat freely like her brother indicates that Sum Jiu’s position as a woman in her culture was strictly below that of men, which shows how deep the repression of women was in her society. However, her grandfather, the highest ranking member of their family according to tradition, went against that cultural structure by giving Sum Jiu special treats at the dinner table, “he’d always topped my bowl of rice with a sliver of salt fish or preserved egg. At festival dinners he’d taken the pearls of flesh from either side of the chicken back...chuckling, ‘Pearls for my Sum Jiu, my Heart’s Pearl.’” (9) In contrast to how Sum Jiu is treated by her mother, the grandfather’s treatment of Sum Jiu was much more doting, and therefore, made Sum Jui seem more out of place. Aside from special treatment at the dinner table, Sum Jiu’s grandfather was also “generous with praise” (9) and tangible rewards such as, “peanuts or lotus seeds, a tickle, a story” (10), which contributed to a close relationship between Sum Jiu and her grandfather that looked out of place in their culture. Because of this special treatment, Sum Jiu became bold as a child, a development that led to her life changing incident.
Living in a culture with a strong belief system, Sum Jiu’s mother uses those religious beliefs to tame Sum Jiu. When Sum Jiu was around seven year of age, she accidentally disrupted her grandfather’s funeral because she thought he was just sleeping and wanted to entertain him. Terrified, her mother tells Sum Jiu that the grandfather’s ghost might haunt them because of what she did, “Now his (Grandfather’s) spirit may get lost… and he will wander like a ghost that belongs nowhere and bring trouble on us all.” (6) Accused of potentially bringing misfortune to the family, Sum Jiu was extremely frightened and probably traumatized, and yet told to keep this incident a secret, “you must be careful not to tell anyone...or the matchmaker will never find a groom for you.” (8), a terrible and unhealthy burden for a young child to carry. Sum Jiu’s mother had scared Sum Jui into submission; by telling Sum Jiu the horrible consequences of the incident she must keep secret, her mother forced her daughter to only look up to her for instruction. Sum Jiu’s mother did actually believe in ghost hauntings herself, so she probably did not purposefully scare Sum Jiu just so to anchor the child’s free spirit. The mother, however, did consciously take advantage of Sum Jiu’s newfound obedience, making her do various chores and hone her skills as a future housewife. 
The author chose the mother’s words carefully to show that it directed Sum Jiu’s mindset. By telling Sum Jiu she must keep it a secret “or the matchmaker will never find a groom for you,” her mother shifts Sum Jiu’s attention towards her secret and away from personal freedom or rebellious thoughts. Making the whole incident a secret layers on extra severity and extra guilt on Sum Jiu as she was vulnerable child, who was oblivious to how much influence her mother had over her. Heavy with the guilt of disturbing her grandfather’s ghost, Sum Jiu accepts her training to become a proper housewife without complaint. Using the belief in ghosts and Sum Jiu’s incident as a catalyst, Sum Jiu’s mother was able to make Sum Jiu accept the gender roles of her culture at the price of Sum Jiu’s freedom from guilt for the rest of her life.
Although Sum Jiu’s experience with religion pushed her to become the obedient woman her society would accept, it also caused her great harm mentally. Because Sum Jiu was made to believe that she disturbed her grandfather’s spirit and might bring misfortune to those around her, she never breaks free of the self blame and guilt that plagued her life after the incident. In a quote that summarizes her mindset after she conforms to social norms, Sum Jiu compared herself to other girls in her village who weren’t burdened by a religiously sensitive secret, “Unlike me, those girls can never be blamed for hiding the truth. They never have to worry that ...(they) might bring sickness, madness, poverty, failure, or some other terrible misfortune...They’re free.” (11) In this quote, she acknowledges that she will never be free of the guilty weight of her innocent mistake as a child. With every single occurrence of the misfortunes she mentions above, she blames herself secretly, and created a huge amount of unnecessary anxiety for herself. For example, when her son Gim Gong was tricked by a sister-in-law, Sum Jiu pointed a finger at herself, thinking, “How could I explain that...I, too, was responsible for his suffering?” (48) Navigating through the treacherous life of a Chinese housewife, Sum Jiu continuously finds herself responsible for misfortunes, most of which are unrelated to her actions, and suffered from the additional guilt her beliefs brought upon her. She never knew that this weight she carried was created by her mother out of a belief in ghosts that her mother used to help her fit in. 
Fanny’s American culture was a world apart from that of Sum Jiu’s, but as a child, Fanny stood out in her socially conservative culture just like Sum Jiu did. When she was young, Fanny wished to go to school instead of practicing the skills of a housewife at home, and took an interest in botany, “All knowledge was meat and drink to me, but studying nature was my chief delight.” (66) She discovered her interests when she went to stay with her uncle, who was an educator and frequently talked about his work with plants. However, when she first requested schooling, her mother replies with, “Every penny of your father’s wages is already spoken for. Besides, you must learn to be useful in the home.” (64) Her mother’s words reflected the cultural expectation of a woman back in her time, that a woman should be competent at housework. Fanny, however, didn’t meet that expectation and stood out amongst her sisters, Phoebe and Cynthia, “Phoebe cooked jellies bright as amber and made samplers of unrivaled beauty. Cynthia - four years my junior - baked light, flaky biscuits. I had difficulty warming milk or bringing a piece of patchwork into conventional shape.” (64) Fanny’s quote was only one of many examples she listed of how she wasn’t fit to be a housewife. When she requested schooling again, her father plainly expressed his disapproval, as Fanny recalls, “There was money then to pay school fees. But Father refused my request. ‘You already know more than enough mathematics to count your children, sufficient geography to find the different rooms in your home. Where you fall short is in the kitchen.’” (65) Obviously backwards and misogynistic in modern terms, what Fanny’s father said is reflective of a time when all the culture expected of a woman was to be good mothers and wives. This quote also reveals that Fanny’s father didn’t see her education as something worthy enough to spend his money on, instead, he pointed out what he thought Fanny needed: better skills in the kitchen. In the culture of 18th century America, where women are expected to be competent, obedient housewives, Fanny stood out because not only did she fail to master house chores, she also wished to pursue a life of knowledge and education.
Fanny’s mother uses the beliefs of her already deeply religious daughter to try to make Fanny become more like her sisters. Growing up in a Christian household, Fanny has complete trust in the words of the Bible and does whatever she could to show her faith in the Lord, and her mother shamelessly uses Fanny’s beliefs to influence her. When Fanny was unable to demonstrate proficiency in cooking or sewing, her mother tells her, “Fanny, you don’t love Jesus. If you did, you’d make more of an effort.” (64), Fanny was overwhelmed with shame and made more of an effort to become better at housework, “I would hang my head and beg forgiveness. I would listen and watch more carefully when she [her mother] demonstrated.” (64) Fanny’s mother was successful only temporarily at motivating her daughter to become more like her sisters, who are essentially the author’s examples of what Fanny’s culture’s model women are. As shown later in the book, Fanny never marries and worked closely with Gim Gong on plant research, ultimately not conforming to cultural standards, however, her mother’s accusation of Fanny for not loving Jesus still left Fanny with stream of self doubt. Fanny is deeply devoted to her religion and knows what is expected of women in her time, so when her own mother points out Fanny’s poor housewife skills and tells her this means she doesn’t love Jesus, it creates a long lasting insecurity that Fanny tries to conceal from herself, a burden that eventually causes her a great deal of harm.
After her mother tried to guilt Fanny into conforming to her gender role with her religion, Fanny’s insecurities with Christianity snowballed and Fanny dealt with them in unhealthy ways. As an adult, Fanny didn’t have her mother to influence her, but because of her fear of not loving Jesus enough made her repress herself. Believing that “all happiness comes from Jesus,” (90) Fanny feared seeking “earthly happiness” because she wanted to prove to herself that she only loves Jesus. Insecure about her faith in the Lord, Fanny actually turns to laudanum, an opiate, to deal with her conflict, which only exacerbated her unstable emotions. When Fanny takes Gim Gong under her wing, it gave her great pleasure to teach him the ways of Western culture despite his initial refusal of Christianity and Fanny’s fear of earthly pleasures, and she admits she could not give up that pleasure just like how she could not give up drugs, “I could not give it up for Truth any more than I could stop stoking hot my love for the Master through laudanum.” (90) Fanny was conflicted because she wanted to be as faithful as possible to God, but finds herself taking pleasure in educating Gim Gong and using laudanum to feel the high that her faith was supposed to give her. It can be clearly seen that her religion becomes a harmful force by giving Fanny a great deal of anxiety that she doesn’t how to deal with on her own. Afraid of not loving Jesus enough, Fanny turns to the conveniently available laudanum to keep her faith alive and quell her insecurities. 
Sum Jiu and Fanny lived in cultures with vastly different beliefs and behavior, and yet, their stories reflect the same pressure to conform from their respective cultures. Sum Jiu was the little girl who stood out because her grandfather favored her, but became a silenced woman with a permanent guilt after her mother used the belief in ghosts to bring her within the village cultural definition of what a woman should be. Fanny stood out because she wasn’t very good at the “work a woman should do” and wanted to pursue meaningful education outside of her housework, only to have her mother accuse her of not being faithful enough and living out the rest of her life troubled with insecurity that led her to become dependent on drugs. With the stories of these two women, the author shows the reader how powerful religion is when it is used as a tool for persuasion, but also how harmful religion can be when used in such a way. The mothers who used religion to make their daughters conform only wanted to prepare their children for adulthood, but the unforeseen effects of forcing a young child’s beliefs against themselves was what changed these beliefs into harmful forces.
